## Failure 1:

1. I found the error by manually checking outputs of arrays with links, and checking that test file to see if it was actually a link. I found </br>
that in [492](https://github.com/nidhidhamnani/markdown-parser/blob/main/test-files/492.md) markdown does not consider the line a link. 
2. The test file that was not outputted correctly is [492](https://github.com/nidhidhamnani/markdown-parser/blob/main/test-files/492.md).
