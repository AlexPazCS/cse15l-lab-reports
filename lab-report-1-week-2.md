## Use shh and input your username, server, and password
Input `$ ssh` followed up by your username, in my case its `cs15lsp22ald` then `@` and finally the server which is `ieng6.ucsd.edu`. The result should look like this: `ssh cs15lsp22ald@ieng6.ucsd.edu`. </brk>

## Try out ssh commands in terminal 
You can use these handy commands:
* `cd` to go to a directory
* `ls` to view the contents of the directory
* `touch` to make a file in the current directory
* `mkdir` to make a new directory in the current directory
* `rm` to remove a file 
* `cp` to copy a file 
* `mv` to move a file
